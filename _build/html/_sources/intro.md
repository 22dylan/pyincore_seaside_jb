# Seaside Notebook Gallery

This Jupyter book contains a collection of [notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) that demonstrate how [IN-CORE](https://incore.ncsa.illinois.edu/) is used at the Seaside, Oregon testbed. The notebooks are related to different components of the IN-CORE flowchart shown below. Some notebooks may focus on a single portion of the flowchart, whereas others may focus on multiple parts of the flowchart. The notebooks presented herein are develoepd by multiple authors; each of which are acknowledged at the begining of their respective notebook.

## Background on Seaside

The North American Pacific Northwest is subject to the rupture of the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ), which is an approximately 1,000 km long fault located between Cape Mendocino California and Vancouver Island, Canada, and separates the Juan de Fuca and North America plates. Rupture of the CSZ can result in both strong earthquake ground shaking and tsunami inundation. The last full rupture of the CSZ occurred in 1700 and is estimated to have had a moment magnitude between 8.7 and 9.2. The city of Seaside is a small coastal town located along the northern Oregon coast, and has a full-time population of approximately 6,700 people. As a popular coastal town, Seaside see's large population flucuations both seasonally (e.g. winter vs. summer population) and weekly (e.g. weekday vs. weekend population). 

Here, Seaside is employed as a testbed community to demonstrate how IN-CORE can be used for communities subject to multiple hazards. The small size of Seaside naturally enables a fine level of analysis leading to a high level of detail. The majority of the analysis in this book are at the parcel level, which is defined as the size of a tax-lot and roughly corresponds to a single building.
